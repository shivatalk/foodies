To satisfy rule 30(4), an examination report on the parent issued following third party observations under section 21 must constitute a \u2018first observations report\u2019 according to rules 29(3)(b) and 29(4).If it does, under rule 30(4), the remaining rule 30 period of the parent is extended to 3 months from the date on which the first observations report was sent and the present divisional application may then be treated as having been filed in time. If not, the compliance period on the parent will only have been extended as of right by two months and the divisional will have been filed four days late. In this event, an auxiliary request was made to accept the application as a late filed divisional.The Hearing Officer heard arguments, inspired by the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in Genentech Inc.\u2019s Patent, that observations in respect of compliance with section 14(5) constitute observations on patentability permitted under section 21; that under section 130(7) of the Act, section 14(5) should, as nearly as practicable, have the same effect as the corresponding provision of the EPC; and that although not explicitly provided for in section 130(7), IPO practice in respect of sections 21 and 76(2) should be in harmony with the EPC and EPO guidelines consistent with section 91(1)(c) of the Act.He carefully considered the arguments and the wording of the Act and Rules which refer to \u201cpatentability\u201d and a \u201cpatentable invention\u201d and found that observations on clarity, support and added matter relating to sections 14(5) and 76(2) did not meet the requirements of section 21 and rule 29(4)(a).He then considered whether the examiner had reported as a consequence of the observations and analysed both the argument that the examiner\u2019s report had \u201cfollowed and mirrored\u201d the observations in part, and the facts that the examiner\u2019s report was not consistent with all of the observations and that the report was based on no new information. On balance he decided that rule 29(4)(b) was not met.Finally, the Hearing Officer considered whether the circumstances were exceptional and that the applicant had been properly diligent such as to exercise the Comptroller\u2019s discretion to allow the application to proceed as a late filed divisional. He decided that the circumstances were not exceptional prior to the divisional application being filed and the applicant had not been diligent despite filing the application quickly once the deadline for doing so had passed. He decided that the Comptroller will not exercise discretion to allow the late filing and so the application may not be accorded divisional status under section 15(9).", "PdfLink": "https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-challenge-decision-results/O01219.pdf"}, {"BL_number": "O/020/19", "Concerning_rights_in": "GB1500399.9 & GB1604348.1", "Hearing_Officer": "Mr P Mason", "Decision_date": "2019-01-11T00:00:00", "Person_s__or_Company_s__involved": "Tracy Buckland", "Provisions_discussed": "Patents Act 1977 sections 1(1)(b), 3, 14(3), 76(2)", "Keywords": "Added subject matter, Inventive step, Sufficiency", "Related_Decisions": "None", "Summary": "The applications each relate to a patient monitoring system comprising a wrist strap which communicates with a physician\u2019s tablet or digital clipboard.

Firstly the Hearing Officer considered whether amendments to the claims made upon entering the national phase constituted added matter and concluded that they did not, because after reading the original specification, which used different terminology in parts, and considering how the invention would be implemented in practice, the skilled person would learn nothing new from the amended claims.Finally the Hearing Officer followed the four step Aerotel/Macrossan test to determine whether there was a technical contribution and considered the AT&T signposts. The identified contribution was not found to provide the required technical effect and the claimed invention was found to relate solely to a program for a computer as such, so the application did not meet the requirements of section 1(2)(c).

The invention receives information from a law enforcement patrol relating to the nature of the patrol, for example whether it is on foot or by vehicle, and the route that is being taken by that patrol. The invention determines an achieved deterrence effect of that patrol. Historical and/or real-time crime information is used by the invention to then determine a difference between a desired threshold level of deterrence and the achieved level of deterrence for a particular patrol route. The invention will then identify an available type of law enforcement patrol that will compensate for the difference and then cause an available law enforcement patrol to be dispatched to the particular patrol route.The Hearing Officer found the invention to be excluded as a computer program, the presentation of information and as a method of doing business and therefore refused the application.", "PdfLink": "https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-challenge-decision-results/O63320.pdf"}, {"BL_number": "O/636/20", "Concerning_rights_in": "GB1505704.5", "Hearing_Officer": "Miss J Pullen", "Decision_date": "2020-12-16T00:00:00", "Person_s__or_Company_s__involved": "Gas Tag Ltd.", "Provisions_discussed": "Section 1(2), 76(2)", "Keywords": "Added subject matter, Excluded fields (refused)", "Related_Decisions": "None", "Summary": "The invention relates to a computer-based system for monitoring maintenance of multiple appliances at multiple premises which uses machine readable tags recording an identifier mounted in physical association with the appliances.

The examiner had argued that the invention did not involve an inventive step over the common general knowledge alone and over three prior art documents. The hearing officer found that he did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the invention did not involve an inventive step over the common general knowledge alone. He did however conclude that vacuum-drying processes for dehydrating molasses would have been well known to the skilled person, as would the desirability of minimising moisture content in molasses products, noting that there were few specific details of such processes disclosed in the application in suit. The hearing officer, considering the common general knowledge of the skilled person and the disclosure of each of the three documents, found that the present invention did not involve an inventive step over each of the three documents when considered in the context of the person skilled in the art\u2019s common general knowledge.
