The motor is fixed to the hull of the space craft so that if the space craft moves, the motor and wheel move with it. The alleged advantage when used in space is that by using magnets, without direct mechanical contact between each wheel and the hull, there is no reaction to the force on the hull applied by the magnetic wheel as it rotates.

To the contrary, there was ample evidence that she was actively engaged in numerous and demanding tasks at the time the renewal fee could have been paid. Moreover, there is clear evidence that she was preoccupied with preparing to display the product covered by her patent at exhibitions and devoted much of her efforts to securing funds for that purpose. However, there is no evidence that she made diligent efforts to obtain funds specifically to pay the renewal fee.

One application was granted and the applicant was invited to withdraw the other application. The applicant argued that under a literal interpretation of Article 3(c) of the Medicinal Products Regulation there was no objection and that this application should be allowed. The applicant further argued that using Article 3(2) of the Plant Protection Regulation to interpret Article 3 of the current Regulation was illegitimate and thus it could not be relied upon. Furthermore, the applicant argued that interpreting Article 3 in the light of Article 3(2) was contrary to the purpose of the Regulation since it reduced, not promoted, the ability of a patent holder to obtain supplementary protection. The applicant also argued that by not allowing the applicant a further certificate they were being treated inequitably and that an uniform solution at Community level, whereby certificates were granted under the same conditions, would not be achieved if the holder of more than one patent were denied the right to be granted more than one certificate, whilst a plurality of certificates for the same product could be granted on the basis of different patents in the hands of two or more holders. The hearing officer rejected these arguments finding that the Regulation did provide a uniform and equitable solution whereby one certificate may be granted under the same conditions to any holder of one or more patents which protect the product in question. Moreover, this is also wholly consistent with Article 3(2) of the Plant Protection Products Regulation, which he was bound to consider in interpreting Article 3. Consequentially, it was not inequitable to deny a patent holder more than one certificate for a product whilst allowing other patent holders one certificate for that product.

But in this case, the claimant\u2019s fiduciary duties as a company director prevent him from doing any of the things that he was asking the Comptroller to authorise him to do.

The inside of the valve body has a chamber shaped with a narrowing section followed by a diversion plate at its outlet so that beer flowing into the keg during filling is directed onto the diversion plate and is deflected sideways to reduce turbulence during filling. The claimant alleged this was known in the light of various physical examples and drawings of prior valves which had similar structure. However there was little in the way of textual disclosure, expert evidence or experimental evidence to support the claimant\u2019s interpretation of the operation of the prior valves. The term \"diversion plate\" in the main claim was construed by the hearing officer to mean a plate which diverts substantially the whole of the flow laterally. The hearing officer also decided that the narrowing of the fluid guide and the diversion plate were cooperating structures and not simply a collocation of features. The prior art was not found to demonstrate that the inventive construction was known or obvious.

The hearing officer found that the patent was invalid (i) under section 72(1)(d) by including matter extending beyond that in the application as filed because the claims had been redrafted to cover a construction in one of the Figures not initially suggested to be part of the invention; and (ii) under section 72(1)(a) because claim 1 lacked inventive step in the light of each of two cited specifications plus common general knowledge in the art.
